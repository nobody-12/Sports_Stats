 Calculating Statistics for the NFL.
 
The files in this folder calculate various statistics from the 2017-2018 season, the singular file in this folder calculates the benefit of homefield advantage to an NFL team. The result shows that homefield advantage gave a 6.9% advantage to the teams in the 2017-18 NFL season. This was found with fivethirtyeight.com's NFL api.
Another project (shedrank.py) calculates the strength of a team's schedule in the past year by looking at it's opponents strength **when the team played**. This is coded in Python 3.6.5 and will print results to console if put into a python interpreter.
