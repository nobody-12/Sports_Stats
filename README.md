 Calculating Statistics for the NFL.
 
The files in this folder calculate various statistics from the 2017-2018 season, the singular file in this folder calculates the benefit of homefield advantage to an NFL team. The result shows that homefield advantage gave a 6.9% advantage to the teams in the 2017-18 NFL season. This was found with fivethirtyeight.com's NFL api.
Another project (average_points_game.py) also attempts to calculate the average score in the 2017-18 NFL Season. This is coded in Python 3.6.5 and will print results to console if put into a python interpreter.
